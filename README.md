## Promotion periods sales performance comparison for a SAMPLE BOOK

This repository mainly serves as a container for a **sales_analysis.ipynb** Jupyter Notebook in which I show an analysis I performed recently. The goal of the analysis was to evaluate a SAMPLE BOOK sales performance on a book-selling platform during two analogous discount periods. The foundation of the analysis was a single dataset provided with a minimal description. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to publicly share the file, even though the dataset has been anonymized.

 **In the sales_analysis.ipynb notebook I first tell a story with the data, and then show my approach to solve different problems (including the relevant Python code).**

The Python code is organized and formatted to make the notebook easier to read, therefore it is not PEP-8 compliant. Especially imports are not clustered at the beginning, but appear in code-cells that first utilize a certain module.


### Skills presented in the notebook:
***Telling a story with data***, ***Python programming***, ***data cleaning***, ***data visualization***, ***statistical inference***, ***simple unstructured data mining/preparation/joining***


### Summary of the analysis:
- **Sale 1** performance was great with average daily **Gross Units Sold increase of 2300%.**
- **One day during Sale 1** generated as much income as **15.6 days before the sale.**
- **Sale 1 had real impact on the book's visibility.**
- **Sale 2** also resulted in **average daily Gross Units Sold increase**, but only **of 940%.**
- **Sale 2** performance was **59% worse than Sale 1**, yielding **66% lower daily income.**
- **Sale 2 had limited impact on the book's visibility.**

It appears that the book had a popularity spike during Sale 1, which contributed greatly to that sale's performance and increased sales even after the promotion. The limited success of Sale 2 might be caused by a lack of such visibility increase and majority of the purchases could be made by people that wanted to buy the book, but were waiting for a discount.

There is a steady flow of new daily purchases and possibly of people discovering the book, but waiting for a promotion to buy it. I would recommend a discount increase for the next big sale, setting it at the *magical 50%* might be the trigger needed for the hesitant to open their wallets.

Additionally, boosting visibility (advertising, positioning) during, or just before a sale could benefit its performance. It appears that some promotion event took place during 7-9 December 2017, but it might have been done too early, or had too small impact.
